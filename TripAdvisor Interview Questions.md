* **What is a hashtable? How to implement? Any advantages and disadvantages? What is the requirement of hash function?**  
HashTable is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the correct value can be found.  
HashTable  

	**Advantages**  
	* Speed. Very efficient when the maximum number of entries can be predicted in advance, so that the bucket array can be allocated once with the optimum size and never resized.
	* Good hash function that is collision-free.
	
	**Disadvantages**
	* Effective hash function for a specific application is more an art than a science.
	* Are not very effective when the number of entries is very small.
	* For certain string processing applications, such as spell-checking, hashtables may be less efficient than tries, finite automata, or Judy arrays.
	* If the keys are not stored, there may be no easy way to enumerate the keys that are present in the table at any given moment.
	* Inefficient when there are many collisions.  
  
	**Requirements of hash function**
	* Uniformity - A good hash function should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over its output range. That is, every hash value in the output range should be generated with roughly the same probability.
	* Determinism - It must be a function of the data to be hashed, in the mathematical sense of the term.
	* Non-invertible - It is not realistic to reconstruct the input datum x from its hash value h(x) alone without spending great amounts of computing time.
	* Data normalization - In some applications, the input data may contain features that are irrelevant for comparison purposes. For example, when looking up a personal name, it may be desirable to ignore the distinction between upper and lower case letters.

BinaryTree -> LevelOrderTraversal

* **Get number of 1's in the binary presentation of an integer.**

* **What's the difference between for and foreach?**

* **What is the difference between array and linked list.**

	| Array | Linked List |
	|:-----:|:-----------:|
	| Size is fixed | Dynamic size |
	| Inserting new element is expensive | Ease of insertion / deletion |
	| Random access is allowed | Random access is not allowed |
	| Better cache locality which affects performance | Extra memory space for a pointer for each element of the list |

* **What are properties of a good hash?**  
	* The hash value is fully determined by the data being hashed.
	* The hash function uses all the input data.
	* The hash function "uniformly" distributes the data across the entire set of possible hash values.
	* The hash function generates very different hash values for similar things.
